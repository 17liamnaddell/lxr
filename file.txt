I like to have fun, it is a great thing. Having fun can ALWAYS be good because it releases endorphins. If you don't know,
endorphins are things released by the brain to give you emotions. If what I just said gave you a bunch of ??!@#$%^&*()_(*&^%$#@#$%^&*'s, then you might want to go back to school, and get some KNOWLEDGE.
